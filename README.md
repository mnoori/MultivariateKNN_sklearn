In this project, we plan to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set we will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car we have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more.

We will use `Scikit-learn` model of python to tackle this problem. We will start with a `univariate k-nearest neighbors` model and end with a `multivariate knn` model.
